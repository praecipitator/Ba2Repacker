  "LongDescription": "# Description\r\nCombines several smaller BA2s into one large one, as a workaround for the BA2 limit.\r\nBA2s get chosen for repacking by file size (smallest first). \r\nFiles which were used for repacking are renamed to \".repacked\" (configurable). \r\nThis gets reversed before the next run.\r\n\r\nVanilla files are NEVER repacked. For CreationClub mods, this can be enabled via the settings.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\n### Main BA2 Limit:\r\nThe patcher will add up all currently installed non-texture BA2s, master files, ESLs, as well as CDX and CSG files.\r\nIf that number is higher than the setting \"Main BA2 Limit\", main BA2s will be precombined to get below it again.\r\n\r\n### Texture BA2 Limit:\r\nTexture BA2s seem to have a different limit, and causes visual issues in-game, instead of a crash after the intro.\r\nFor this limit, only the Texture BA2s are counted and must be below the configured number.\r\n\r\n### Maximal Filesize (MB):\r\nBA2s above this size will never be repacked.\r\n\r\n### Repack CreationClub Mods:\r\nThis has three options: \"Always\", \"Never\", \"Manual\" (default).\r\n\"Manual\" means, CC mods aren't being treated different from any other mods, and will follow black- or whitelist rules.\r\n\"Always\" and \"Never\" set CC mods to be either always or never repackable respectively, overriding any black- or whitelisting.\r\nKeep in mind that CC mods can have their BA2s restored, when you revalidate files via Steam. You would need to run the Synthesis pipeline again after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Whitelist Mode\r\nIn whitelist mode, only mods specified in the whitelist can have their BA2s repacked, and nothing else.\r\nOtherwise, all mods except the ones specified in the blacklist below are.\r\nKeep in mind that vanilla files are NEVER repacked, no matter the lists, and the settings \"Always\" or \"Never\" of the option \"Repack CreationClub Mods\"\r\nwill override any black- or whitelisting.\r\n\r\n### Disabled BA2 suffix\r\nWhen a BA2 was used for repacking, this will be added to it's filename. Keep in mind that the patcher also uses this suffix to find repacked BA2s when restoring them,\r\nso only change it if you are know what you're doing!\r\nDefault: \".repacked\"\r\n\r\n### MO2 Settings:\r\n#### Use MO2 mode, if possible:\r\nIf enabled, the patcher will try to detect whenever it is being run through MO2, and switch to MO2 mode if necessary.\r\nMO2 mode means, the patcher will attempt to make sure that repacked BA2s stay within the proper MO2 mod subfolder,\r\notherwise, they will all end up in Overwrite.\r\nThis should now work with both regular and portable installations.\r\n\r\n#### Override MO2 Profile Name:\r\nIf left empty, the patcher will try to read the current selected MO2 profile from the config files.\r\nOtherwise, the currently-used profile will be used (\"selected_profile\" in the current ModOrganizer.ini).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Override ModOrganizer.ini path:\r\nIf the automatic MO2 detection isn't working for you, you can specify a full path to your ModOrganizer.ini file here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer: \r\nThis patcher seems to have worked fine so far, but, due to the way it works, bugs might affect the archives of your installed mods.\r\nUse at your own risk.\r\n",
